## 2024-05-23 - Unbounded Waveform Cache
**Learning:** The `TimelineCanvas` was storing generated waveform `QPainterPath` objects in an unbounded dictionary (`_waveform_path_cache`). Since the cache key depends on the zoom level (pixel width), zooming in and out created thousands of unique keys, causing unlimited memory growth.
**Action:** Implemented LRU eviction for the waveform path cache using `OrderedDict` with a capacity limit (default 1000). This ensures memory stability during long editing sessions involving zooming, without impacting the smoothness of scrubbing (since visible clips are prioritized in the cache).
